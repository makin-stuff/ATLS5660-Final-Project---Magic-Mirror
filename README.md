# ATLS5660-Final-Project---Magic-Mirror

This is the code for *Magic Mirror* by Priyanka Makin.

This code was written for a system built with these parts:
* [Adafruit 32 x 32 RGB LED Matrix](https://www.adafruit.com/product/607?gclid=CjwKCAiAhreNBhAYEiwAFGGKPLyKmpOMsPmFADW-sVaGsMtw4pF-MnkRT68XNP6t5C9hieqCoeeirxoCOxAQAvD_BwE)
* [Adafruit RGD Matrix shield](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2601?gclid=CjwKCAiAhreNBhAYEiwAFGGKPM_yWIyxP7m4DSMBx_TYMOgiudooy_cyt5oubG4uiETv_9T6GfSTURoCYZYQAvD_BwE)
* [SparkFun RedBoard Turbo](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14812)
* [2A power supply](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15664)
* [micro-B USB cable](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10215)

The sketches in the "Arduino" directory are meant to run on the RedBoard Turbo and the Processing sketches on the computer. Sketches with the same number are meant to be run together.
